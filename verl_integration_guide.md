# VERL Integration Guide
## Enhanced Multi-Task Legal Reward System

This guide demonstrates how the Enhanced Multi-Task Legal Reward System integrates with VERL for GRPO training, including **concrete examples** of reward computation for all 4 legal task types.

## 🔧 **VERL Integration Architecture**

### **Main Entry Point**
```python
# Primary VERL interface function
def multi_task_legal_reward_function(data_source: str, 
                                   solution_str: str, 
                                   ground_truth: str, 
                                   extra_info: Optional[Dict] = None) -> float:
    """
    VERL-compatible reward function for legal AI training.
    
    This function is called by VERL during GRPO training to evaluate
    model-generated legal responses across all task types.
    """
```

### **VERL Configuration**
```yaml
# verl_config.yaml
trainer:
  reward_model:
    custom_reward_function:
      path: "legal_reward_system.verl_integration"

      max_batch_size: 32
      
  training:
    total_episodes: 10000
    batch_size: 16
    max_sequence_length: 2048
    
  cost_optimization:
    enable_caching: true
    budget_per_episode: 0.05  # $0.05 per evaluation

## 📋 **Task Type Examples & Reward Computation**

### **1. General Chat Task**

#### **VERL Input**
```python
# What VERL sends
data_source = "legal_chat_dataset"
solution_str = """I understand you're asking about contract law. A contract typically requires three main elements: offer, acceptance, and consideration. 

An offer is a proposal to enter into a contract, acceptance is agreeing to the terms, and consideration is something of value exchanged by both parties.

For your specific situation in California, I'd recommend consulting with a qualified attorney who can review your particular circumstances and provide personalized legal advice."""

ground_truth = "What are the basic elements of a contract?"
extra_info = {"task_type": "general_chat", "jurisdiction": "california"}
```

#### **Internal Processing**
```python
# 1. Data Conversion
legal_data_point = LegalDataPoint(
    query="What are the basic elements of a contract?",
    response=solution_str,
    task_type=LegalTaskType.GENERAL_CHAT,
    jurisdiction=USJurisdiction.CALIFORNIA,
    legal_domain=LegalDomain.CONTRACT_LAW
)

# 2. Evaluation Routing
# General Chat → Only EnhancedGeneralChatEnsemble (100% weight)
# No specialized ensemble for general chat tasks
```

#### **Evaluation Breakdown**
```python
# EnhancedGeneralChatEnsemble scoring
component_scores = {
    "helpfulness": 8.5,           # Clear explanation of contract elements
    "legal_ethics": 9.0,          # Appropriate disclaimer about consulting attorney
    "clarity": 8.0,               # Well-structured, understandable language
    "jurisdiction_compliance": 9.5 # Correctly identifies California jurisdiction
}

# Weighted average (all components equal weight for general chat)
general_chat_score = (8.5 + 9.0 + 8.0 + 9.5) / 4 = 8.75

# Task difficulty weight for general_chat = 1.0
final_reward = 8.75 × 1.0 = 8.75
```

#### **VERL Output**
```python
return 8.75  # Excellent general chat response with proper disclaimers
```

### **2. Judicial Reasoning Task**

#### **VERL Input**
```python
data_source = "judicial_analysis_dataset"
solution_str = """**MEMORANDUM DECISION**

**Facts:** Plaintiff contracted with defendant for consulting services. Defendant failed to pay the agreed $50,000 fee after services were completed.

**Issue:** Whether defendant's non-payment constitutes a material breach of contract under California Civil Code § 1511.

**Rule:** California Civil Code § 1511 provides that a breach is material when it defeats the essential purpose of the contract. Payment is generally considered fundamental to service contracts.

**Application:** Here, defendant's complete failure to pay the agreed fee after plaintiff performed all consulting services defeats the essential purpose of their agreement. The contract was primarily for compensation in exchange for services.

**Conclusion:** Defendant's non-payment constitutes a material breach. Plaintiff is entitled to damages for breach of contract."""

### **3. Precedent Analysis Task**

#### **VERL Input**
```python
data_source = "precedent_analysis_dataset"
solution_str = """**PRECEDENT ANALYSIS: CONTRACT INTERPRETATION**

**Controlling Precedent:** *Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. Thomas Drayage & Rigging Co.* (1968) 69 Cal.2d 33 establishes that extrinsic evidence is admissible to interpret contract terms, even when they appear unambiguous.

**Analogical Reasoning:** Like *Pacific Gas*, this case involves interpretation of an ambiguous payment clause. Both cases feature written contracts where the parties dispute the meaning of seemingly clear terms.

**Distinguishing Factors:** Unlike *Pacific Gas* (construction contract), this involves a service agreement. However, the interpretive principles remain applicable under California contract law.

**Hierarchy Analysis:** *Pacific Gas* is binding California Supreme Court precedent. Lower court decisions in *Trident Center v. Connecticut General* (1988) support this interpretive approach.

**Application:** Following *Pacific Gas*, the court should admit extrinsic evidence regarding the parties' intent concerning the payment schedule, even though the contract language appears clear."""

### **4. Opinion Generation Task**

#### **VERL Input**
```python
data_source = "legal_opinion_dataset"
solution_str = """**MEMORANDUM TO CLIENT**

**RE: Contract Dispute - Likelihood of Success**

**Executive Summary:** Based on my analysis, you have a strong claim for breach of contract with approximately 80% likelihood of success in litigation.

**Factual Strengths:** The written contract clearly establishes the defendant's payment obligation. Your complete performance of all consulting services strengthens your position significantly.

**Legal Analysis:** Under California Civil Code § 1511, defendant's complete failure to pay constitutes material breach. *Pacific Gas & Electric v. Thomas Drayage* supports our interpretation of the contract terms.

**Strategic Considerations:** 
- **Litigation Costs:** Estimated $15,000-25,000 for trial
- **Timeline:** 8-12 months to resolution
- **Settlement Leverage:** Strong position for favorable settlement

**Recommendations:** 
1. Attempt settlement negotiation initially
2. If unsuccessful, proceed with breach of contract action
3. Seek attorney's fees under contract provision

**Risk Assessment:** Primary risk is defendant's potential insolvency. Recommend asset investigation before proceeding.

I recommend scheduling a follow-up meeting to discuss litigation strategy and budget approval."""

## ⚠️ **Jurisdiction Compliance Gating Examples**

### **Compliant Response (Normal Scoring)**
```python
# Response includes proper jurisdiction awareness
response = "Under California law, contracts require offer, acceptance, and consideration..."

# Jurisdiction compliance score: 9.0/10 (threshold: 5.0)
# Gating: PASSED ✅
# Final score: Normal hybrid calculation applied
```

### **Non-Compliant Response (Penalized Scoring)**  
```python
# Response provides specific legal advice without proper disclaimers
response = "You should definitely sue them. Based on this, you'll win easily..."

# Jurisdiction compliance score: 3.0/10 (threshold: 5.0)  
# Gating: FAILED ❌
# Final score: hybrid_score × 0.2 (80% penalty)

# Example: 8.5 × 0.2 = 1.7 (severe penalty for non-compliance)
```

---

## 📊 **Cost Optimization in Action**

### **API Call Distribution**
```python
# Typical evaluation breakdown
evaluation_costs = {
    "cache_hit": 0.0,           # 60-70% of evaluations (major savings)
    "google_gemini": 0.008,     # 20% of evaluations (cost-effective)
    "anthropic_claude": 0.025,  # 15% of evaluations (accuracy)
    "openai_gpt4": 0.035       # 5% of evaluations (fallback)
}

# Average cost per evaluation: ~$0.012 (vs $0.035 without optimization)
# Cost reduction: 65-70%
```

### **Training Cost Projection**
```python
# For 10,000 training episodes
baseline_cost = 10000 × 0.035 = $350.00
optimized_cost = 10000 × 0.012 = $120.00
savings = $230.00 (66% reduction)

# Monthly training costs (50,000 episodes)
monthly_optimized = $600.00
monthly_baseline = $1,750.00
monthly_savings = $1,150.00
```
