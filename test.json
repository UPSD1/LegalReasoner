ISSUE: Whether Dr. Smith's diagnostic decisions met emergency medicine standard of care.

Circuit patterns in excessive force: immunity denied when force clearly excessive with obvious alternatives; immunity granted for novel factual scenarios or split-second decisions. 'Clearly established' requires specific precedent with similar facts, not general constitutional principles. Trend toward broader immunity grants despite constitutional violations, creating circuit splits and calls for Supreme Court reconsideration."

ISSUE: Whether material cost increases excuse performance or constitute breach of fixed-price contract. RULE: Fixed-price contracts generally allocate market risk to contractor; impossibility/impracticability defense requires extreme and unforeseeable circumstances; breach triggers damages for cover costs and delays. APPLICATION: 40% price increase significant but markets inherently volatile; COVID supply chain issues arguably foreseeable business risk; fixed-price contract language shows risk allocation; abandonment constitutes material breach triggering cover damages. CONCLUSION: ElectricCo likely liable for breach; BuildCorp entitled to excess completion costs ($100k) plus delay damages; impracticability defense unlikely to succeed absent extreme circumstances."

HOAs can enforce aesthetic rules if: properly authorized in CC&Rs, reasonably applied, and procedurally fair. Document other colorful doors with photos, review CC&R language carefully, and request HOA enforcement records. Challenge vague terms and demand consistent application. Consider requesting architectural committee review or mediation. Business judgment rule protects reasonable HOA decisions, but arbitrary enforcement and vague rules are vulnerable to challenge."

ISSUE: Whether evidence establishes willful tax evasion beyond reasonable doubt. RULE: Criminal tax evasion requires: (1) tax deficiency, (2) willful attempt to evade, (3) affirmative act of evasion; good faith reliance on professional may negate willfulness. APPLICATION: $500k unreported income establishes substantial deficiency; false loss returns and offshore accounts show affirmative evasion acts; 3-year pattern suggests willful conduct; accountant reliance defense undermined by false information provided.
